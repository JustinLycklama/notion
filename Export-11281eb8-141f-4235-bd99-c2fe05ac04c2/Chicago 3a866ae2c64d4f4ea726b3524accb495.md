# Chicago

[March 2024 Plan](March%202024%20Plan%2064c90691f64f4063bad548f719e3c29d.md)

## General

—The Art Institute = One of my favorite art museums in the world. Can’t see it all in one day, so just do a portion, get a cocktail inside and then unwind somewhere else. ✅

-**Chicago Cultural Center** 

—Second City = yes, Toronto has one, but this is the original.
—Show at the Empty Bottle = Lots of cool small venue joints for music shows. This one is a classic.✅
—Sears Tower (now called Willis Tower) = If you wanna do something touristy.
—Walk Michigan Ave = Like Sears Tower, only do this if you want to do something touristy and stretch your legs.✅
—China Town = Chicago’s China town area is really small, but it’s not bad to walk around and check out if you wanna kill time on that side of town.
—SKIP: Navy Pier (super touristy)

PLACES TO EAT:
—Only tourists eat deep dish pizza. If you want a real Chicago pizza experience I recommend “Aurelios” in downtown (there’s a few locations around city). If you want a unique pizza experience, “Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder”. But if they insist on a deep dish experience, I prefer Gino’s East
—Portillo’s Italian Beef (order Italian beef with HOT PEPPERS!)
—Monks Pub (beer place just across river from River North)

### River North

**Three Dots and a Dash - Tiki bar**

—Monks Pub (beer place just across river from River North)

# Neighbourhoods

Like Toronto, Chicago is a neighbourhood city. You’ll want to spend most of your time there. It’s where you’ll fall into the local gems and haunts. There’s A LOT of neighbourhoods, but these three are good for a first time visitor (or someone that just has a weekend).

## Wicker Park

—Bars: “The Hideout”, “Subterranean” (for live shows),
—The area around North/Damen/Milwaukee has plenty to check out and explore. So I’d walk around there.
—Small Cheval is popular burger joint (personally, I think it’s overrated, but I’m in the minority with my friends on that).

## Logan Square

—Bars: “Estereo”, “The Whistler” , “The Owl”
—Places to eat: Fat Rice, Cella Door Provisions, Flat & Point BBQ

## Pilsen

—Bars: “Simones”, “Skylark” , “The Green Room Tap”
—Places to eat: If you’re going to eat good Mexican in Chicago, Pilsen will have good mom and pop joints. Honky Tonk BBQ is also an ok BBQ joint (also have live shows on occasion).
—The Mexican Art Museum is cool and overlooked.
—The Bridgeport neighborhood is just south of Pilsen, and worth checking if time permits: Maria’s Packaged Goods has good house music and drinks. Kimski is next door, it’s a Polish/Korean street food joint.

## Other

-Dovetail Brewery (I think one of the better breweries in town) / The Green Mill (classic joint for small shows and poetry reads) / Friar Tuck (divey bar in Lake View area)
-Phodega (they make a Vietnamese Italian Beef sandwich I hear is goo) / Qing Xiang Yuan Dumplings (best dumpling joint in city) / Chilam Balam (Mexican joint in Lakeview) / Kasama (James Beard awarded chefs) / Gogi (Korean place, haven’t gone, heard great) / Parachute (Korean place, heard great) / Crisp (famous for wings, but I think Output Sports Lounge is better), 3 Little Pigs ( elevated Chinese street food, I haven’t gone yet, but it’s been on my to-go list for a while) / Output Sports Lounge (on Grand Ave)= Best chicken wings in town
