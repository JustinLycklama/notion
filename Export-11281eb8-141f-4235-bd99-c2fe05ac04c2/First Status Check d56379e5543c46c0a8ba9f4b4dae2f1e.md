### Outcome

We have been in a negative cycle for the last few months, maybe longer. Erin is looking for affection and confirmation that I love her by asking if I love her, and the repetition and frequency is causing me to answer less and less positively. 

We currently share all the hobbies we want to, and do not feel the need for our own separate activities. We have enough alone time given our house, we can spend out own time on a different floor. One mismatch is Erin misses me faster than I miss her; when she is with her parents in Winnipeg for 1 week she misses me and wants updates often. We also talked about how this could just be due to not having fun in Winnipeg - When she was away for the weekend with her friends at an all inclusive she did not miss me.

Minor item: We need to increase our date frequency by just a bit, or increase romance levels on any given date. We need to make sure to spend 1:1 time at least once a week. I should be on the lookout for specific events that we should block out time for, in addition to filling out unused nights of the week.

Major item: I need to communicate to Erin that I would be unhappy without her in my life, and that I do not take her for granted. I need to find a set of actions I can take, in place of saying ‘I love you’, to affirm to her every day that I still love her and am happy to have her in my life.

Major item: Erin is no longer going to ask if I love her. In its place, I need to setup Status Check meetings to ask how she has been feeling, and if there is anything we can change
