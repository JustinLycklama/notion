# Relationship

Erin needs to see affection. I cannot deal with excessive words of affection and am rebuffing her attempt to reach out for love. 

She is not going to ask me if I love her anymore, and in return I need to make a strong effort to remind her I love her each day. 

### Nonverbal Communication

*The best thing I can give Erin is attention. This is not a specific action, but how we interact each day*

- Attentive listening
- Eye contact
- Stop trying to get things done for a while, just sit and give Erin my full attention

### Words of affirmation

*Just because this does not work for me, does not mean I can never say them*

- I appreciate you; having you, being with you, who you are
- I love you and care for you

### Physical Affection

*Simple physical touches while doing basic activity remind her I appreciate her company*

- Touch on the arm
- Kiss

### Random Acts

- Sage smudge stick morning blessing
- Bring her food while she works

### Surprises
