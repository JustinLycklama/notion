## Figure 4

Provides tension when pulled, able to slide knot along rope

1. Create figure 4 with rope: origin is top of 4, new rope sticks out to the right, back again to cross original rope at a 90 degree angle
2. from inside the 4, pull the end through
3. once again, pull it through
4. tighten and pull new rope away from origin
5. finish with finger gun knot, without the loop (pull rope all the way through instead of creating tail loop)
