# Third Status Check

State: Done

1. What does intimacy mean to you?

Many things

Intimacy in proximity, in touch, cuddles, in bed

Intimacy in being comfortable in silence together. I personally do not have anyone I feel comfortable with being together in complete silence: Erin could sit in a room with Irene and just hangout without doing an activity. For me, I only do that with Erin, and knowing that brings Erin joy.

Intimacy in shared experience and understanding. Fully able to express your thoughts to each other, and for them to be understood and reciprocated by the other person, is an intimacy shared romantically and with friends.

1. Where does intimacy fall on your relationship priority list?

Romantic intimacy specifically is very important. We could not specify exactly what that is, but Erin values an intimacy that could only shared between the two of us.

1. Do you feel sexually satisfied in our relationship?

Yes.
