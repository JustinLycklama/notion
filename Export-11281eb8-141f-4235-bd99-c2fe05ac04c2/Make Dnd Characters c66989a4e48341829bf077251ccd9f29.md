I can also easily help edit it. The DnD beyond is also well designed in a sense that it will walk you through the process, even you don't really master the rules yet.

And for the sake of the story, your characters should not be more than 35 years old in human age (you can adapt depending the race you choose).

But the idea is you guys know each others for a long time as you all grew up on a not so big island where almost anyone knows everyone and you never had the chance to travel outside of this island.
