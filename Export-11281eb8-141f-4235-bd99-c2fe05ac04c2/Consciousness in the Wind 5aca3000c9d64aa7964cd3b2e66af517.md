# Consciousness in the Wind

The conscious, decision making mind is an entity that floats around the earth, like the wind.

People when born have no connection to an entity for the first few years of life. Connections are attempted and brief thoughts are formed by babies, but generally the baby is driven by basic needs and emotions.

Once the right connection is found, the entity will remain for decades, possibly the rest of their life. The connection could change based on environment, humans disposition, …

The earth sets an ultimatum collectively to the entities: reverse your ham on the earth or I will no longer let you connect with humans

humans collectively build machine / ecosystem hybrid, to reverse effects they have caused

as they are building the system, the earths promise begins to take effect: people begin to react more on impulse, on emotion, on desire. 

Written from the perspective of the entity (our consciousness), the scope of their surroundings begins to expand. From a person, to a room (sometimes watching as a 3rd party to the actions their human performs), to a household, .. growing to encompass landscapes, to viewing the world in its current state of destruction, but also the attempts we had at fixing it.

Straining to make connections with humans, to guide their actions. succeeding less and less. Over time, indifference sets in

As centuries pass, the systems built by humans start to have a positive effect on the planet. Our main character Entity takes interest in them and starts to zoom in his focus.

The first connection is made once more, just a brief touch, as our entity sees someone struggling and nudges them in the right direction, before being pushed back into the wind and off to find their ‘soul mate’.

---

We follow the main character as they prompt their human to make the right choices. The distinction between human and entity is not made.

This story has a higher level than ‘making the right choices in eating habits’ or something similar, it should be felt on a grand scale. The sense of floating through landscapes and poplations should be present throughout, I don’t want to start with frivolous choices.

// friend setting, listening to others, sharing your experiences

Update:

We need a harder choice, something that is easy but immoral. something primal, that really highlights the idifference between the animal self and the conciousness 

Remember this is NOT yourself. Is this person Volunteering? doing something for the community?

Handing out blankets, food, to people in need. Particularly tough situation, people being rude, fighting, … leads to revulsion. Wanting to skip this group of people, tell them they get nothing, or be equally rude back. Tensions build as one side throws abuse, while the other tries to remain composure.

I handed out the last package. With a grunt, the man took it back to the sidewalk and settled in to his blanket, staring at the pavement. As I grabbed my things and left the crowded underpass, I felt a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips. 

It was satisfying, more than I thought it would be. I had inititally rejected the idea outright, waking up early on one of my few days off to volunteer? More work. No pay. Little thanks, if any. As much as I didn’t want to, I could not seem to let the thought go. There was some guilt, a mental termoil waged between the me who wanted to be better and *do* better, and the me who acted on impulse. The part of me that was, simply put, human.  

My sense of satisfaction was beginning to wear off, replaced by a growing pit in my stomach as I rounded the church corner and saw the group ahead. I’d seen them a week ago, tents pitched in a public park, either yelling their heads off to anyone who passed by, or begging for cash. 

  

“Back off!” I could already hear the kid yelling from down the street. “I told you every fucking day, I don’t need to feel your breath on my ear, I’m not deaf!”

A group of kids, I thought of them as kids anyway, sat along a high curb of a mcdonalds parking lot getting pissy at each other. They were probably almost 20, but were some of the most entitled, angsty, *angry* people I’d had the misfortune of coming across.

As I approached, the guy I’d heard yelling earlier turned around and his eyes lit up. I almost let myself believe he was happy to see me. Almost.

“Oh praise the lord!” he exclaimed as he threw his arms into the air. “Our saviour has come”.

This whole group looked different from most on the street. Loose clothes, baggy pants, but almost.. fashionable? Greasy hair, but not disheleved. Almost like they wanted to come live in the city, but forgot to find a job and couldn’t be bothered to look.

“What have you got there? A blanket! How could you afford such a treasure?!”
”Look, its getting colder so we’ve started handing out…”

“Fuck your blanket” his mock experssion of joy ripped off his face.

“And fuck you. You come down here, probably take a selfie being ‘oh so generous’, and get off being a smug asshole the rest of the week. ”

I could feel myself getting defensive, but I just started counting out packages and tried to deescalate.
“Yeah I get it, I’m just gonna leave these here in case-‘

He pushed me back, and not too gently either. Dispite his earier reminders to his friend, he was right up beside me, breath hot in my face.

“Do you have ears? NO”

My vision narrowed and flash of anger sprang up in me, overcoming the fear. All I wanted to do in that moment was push him back. Or yell right in his face. Maybe both. I had to protect myself, and I *really* wanted to yell at this guy. 

*Don’t.* I told myself. *Not a good look.*  

I managed to respect my own wishes, barely. I could tell this anger needed redirecting, not cutting off.

*The others on the curb don’t seem to share his enthusiasm,* I pushed. *You got this.* 

as I sidestepped him I put all of my attention on a younger guy who looked a bit uncomfortable and said to the space at large with an air of exaguration,  
“Alright! I get it, you don’t need help from anyone. Since I’ve come all this way though, I’m going to finish being an asshole.”

I handed the bags I had been couting earlier to the kid, and as I did I continued right on past. “You look like you could use a few extras, here.”

The first guy continued to yell back at me, half following, half circling his friends. I can hear him trailing further behind, it doesn’t seem like he needs to confront me.

*He’s really just talking to the wind at this point*, I realize. *He’s letting whatever twist-of-fate brought him here have an earful, and we just happened to get in the way.*

We make a good team, myself and I. We’ve spent years working on this balance within ourself. I am a natural of course, and after a few decades of trying to manage emotions and reason, my lizard-brained self was really beginning to shine as well. I could feel him take pride in being able to express himself.. fluently. Fluently both within the social dynamics his world is built upon, and in the thoughtfulness of mine.

This intimacy we have isn’t common when people are young. I’m not sure how I know this, its not like I have memory that far back. 
My memory begins when we really started to click, his animal drive guided by my considerate nature. Thats when we really started become ourself.

 I think he used to have something close to this, but the match was not quite perfect. I sense there was a lack of confidence, or a suppression of emotion back then. My memories do not go that far back however, so I can only guess. I imagine this previous match lasted quite a while, I can tell from his new found sense of freedom. It is clearly novel to be at home with himself, and that the change has been a long time coming.

Before that, who knows. In infancy, something happens in humans that is unique to any other animal. I cannot explain it, but I am drawn to them. They are curious, they learn so rapidly, yet they are reckless! And they do not treat each other well. As my curiosity grows I draw near, my conciousness narrowing to encapulate only them and their interests. We do not connect at this age, mearly brush one and other. I give them a moments wisdom; *your friend would not like to be hit, share your toys with your brother, be kind*… But It is not meant to be. I am rejected, in anger or confusion, blown in a torrent of emotional wind out into the larger world, drifting until my attention is caputred once more. 

As children grow they become more accepting, and our connections will form longer lasting personalities. These matches, like a person trying on clothes, cannot be permanent. Big events, the childs parents and friends, their environment,.. all twist together with their animal instincts and emotional responses, clashing with my suggestion. I do not blame them, they are young. But I would be lying if I said it does not hurt.

> when I am ripped from them, my vision blurring and expanding from the bubble of one person to the houses down the street, the road in the distance, and the rolling hills of the countryside as I swept from their life.

Still, now, it is as if I have been with no other. I do not remember my previous lives, though I know I have lived many.

My human is happy. He lives a good life of both thoughtfulness and indulgence. He has an outlet for his emotion, and he can tell I am thriving right along side with him.

Years pass. I am content.

One day, something new occurs. Not new for us as a personality, but … *new.* While I am sleeping, letting myself spin through a series of emotions, urges and an unbelievable lack of spacial reasoning, I am suddenly pulled away in to nothingness. 

It is there I heard the Earth speak for the first and only time.  

‘You are not doing enough.’

I hung there, waiting for more, but nothing came. The abrupt message was left echoing in the silence, heavy with guilt. Each passing moment I felt more frantic. 

‘Not enough? I’ve completely turned this human’s life around. We’ve overcome fears, we are helping others.. we are happy!’ 

I could feel myself slipping away from this place. I was dragged here in an instant, but now it felt like the hand holding me had uncupped their fingers, and let me fall lthrough the cracks ike sand back to where I came from.

 Not sure if I want this to be everyone, or just me…

> As I was released from the void, I could feel the conciousness of millions of others be free as well, slipping out of that space and back to wherever they came from.
> 

We spent the new few days a bit cloudy, woolgathering more often than not. I couldn’t concentrate on our life, I was fixated on that reality shattering moment. It was not a dream. Dreaming is something my other half does essentially on his own, I am just along for the ride.

I knew this was real, and it was the first thing I had experienced outside of my current body for years. 

“You are not doing enough.”

I began to push harder. Suddenly helping out in my community wasn’t cutting it. My interest in my current life began to dampen, replaced with a desire to be in nature. I wanted to help future generations by reversing the environmental trajectory of today. I wanted to help the planet.

It wasn’t only me.  There was a huge uptick of corporate responsibility in the green space. Companies making their products reusable and repairable, lowering their emissions and energy consumption. People were going out of their way to conserve and clean, the urgency palpable, a fine web of anxiety pulled taught across the world.  There was a general agreement that this movement was caused by the recent ticking of the climate clock; as we approach midnight we need to take immediate action to dig ourselves out of this hole. Deep down we knew something else had begun, and had kicked us into overdrive.

> I need to speed up time here, or do a big time jump. I can jump forward to our human working on larger project, part of many that will eventually fix everything. But also during this time. the connection is fading, and ‘our’ conciousness wavers between soley on the human and to the room, the house, … beyond. The chapter ends with the connection weakened to the point of breaking

> Time skip again for the next chapter. Now we are the floating, indifferent entity that we have been building towards. We see occasional humans, continuing on the work that was started years ago, working towards fixing the environment still. young people are especially out of control, those who have lived with a conscience are still working towards the goal

Was the earth sick previously?

I closed the door to my appartment, eagerly awaiting my cold shower. The humidity in Sao Paulo

still got to me, even after three years here.

It was hard to believe when I first arrived the lack of AC. Back home, most homes had some sort of climate control. Central air or a least a wall or window unit, and it was freezing half of the year anyway. I had just expected, moving to Brazil, working on revitalizing the rainforest,
