# Registering a Business (Apple)

I've just gone through this process and want to provide a tutorial for others because I believe more will stumble upon this thread. There's currently not a lot of info out there. Hopefully this will fast-track some of you.

There are some things to clarify. Both a business number (BN) and RT number are required, even though the RT will be voluntary (Apple requires both in the tax form). The RT is for HST/GST tax collection purposes and is essentially a sub-account within the business number. So you'll need to get the BN first, and then apply for the RT number from within your BN. You will ultimately need to attach this to your SIN.

I registered as a sole proprietorship using this link: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business/register.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business/register.html)

You'll want to register through the Business Registration Online portal. Click the 'Register' button.

After going through the step-by-step registration process (very easy and straight forward), you will finally reach a page where it is complete and you will have been given a Business Number. This is a 9 digit number. From this point, you have the opportunity to continue on and also register for a RT account (otherwise known as a GST/HST account). Both are required, so go ahead and go through that as well. CRA mentions you can estimate your annual sales if unsure. (You can read more about this here: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html))

In the Apple developer account, form 506, enter these numbers as applicable (both BN and RT). BEFORE SUBMITTING: Make sure you preview your tax form. Ensure the BN and RT fields are correct. The CRA website will give you a long RT number that also includes your BN in it, but it’s really just the last 4 characters (for me at least) of the whole RT number that you need. Example: RT0001 and you can just slot in “0001”. Again, just check the preview tax form.
