# Short Story

The type of stories I like.. spooky? culty. unexplained. Archive 81, the Watcher..

It doesn’t matter if its copied. This is about WRITING, the creativity can be small at first.

hotel, someone is stuck over the couse of a week. waking up a night to a chorus of chanting? some sounds through the radiator.

Maybe it begins as one week, and turns into a month+. the staff are shocked when they learn the person plans to stay over 2 weeks, will not explain why.

A few strange people exist nearby, maybe they are not staying in the hotel but permanent residents in houses or appartments nearby. 

Shared areas

Hotel bar, dining room, gym

This would be in a decently sized city, where a hotel would exist ‘downtown’
