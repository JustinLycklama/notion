Give Toby Churru (or 1/2 can wet food) some time in the evening, mixed with water in a bowl. He will meow to remind you.

## Just in case

### Auto-feeder

You shouldnâ€™t need to do anything with this, but just in case here is the current set up.

It dispenses 7-10 pieces each time it activates, and here is the current schedule.

| 12am | 2 meals |
| --- | --- |
| 8am | 1 meal |
| 12pm | 2 meals |
| 6pm | 1 meal |

You can listen for the kibble hitting the bowl when it goes off. It is plugged in but has battery backup if the power goes out.

We have had no issues with it, but keep an ear out if he seems desperate for food and make sure you hear it I guess?
