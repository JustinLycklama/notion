# Fourth Status Check

State: Done

Its been a month since we did a ‘tracked’ date, I’m sure we did things in that month but without the questions

1. How have you been feeling about my attention this past month
2. Have you had any big negative events. Possibly new years?
3. Have I been doing anything specifically annoying lately

3.1 I am going to do my best to stop talking about how things could be better.. I feel like I complain a lot and I'm annoying myself with that, maybe I'm projecting onto youvn

1. Are you still okay cooking? I don’t do nearly as much work around the house.
2. I want to try to enact what we talked about a month ago - spending one day a week where we are very focused on each other, talking / listening and feeling closer to each other, and less time on other days feeling like we need to be present for the sake of being present. You mentioned recently, ‘you don’t need to entertain me’. And I realized I do feel guilty sometimes and hang around for no reason? I’m not sure why I do that.
