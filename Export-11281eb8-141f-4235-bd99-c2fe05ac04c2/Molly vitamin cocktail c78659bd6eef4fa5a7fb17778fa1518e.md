# Molly vitamin cocktail

My friend sent the following tips to make MDMA gentler on the brain, probably the MOST IMPORTANT is the 5htp:

Before and during:

Ginger (prevent stomach upset)

Acetyl-L-carnitine (Neuro protective)

Vitamin C (antioxidant for oxidative stress)

Magnesium (prevents jaw clenching, relaxes muscles)

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (Neuro protective)

CoQ10 (antioxidant for oxidative stress)

Electrolyte pill (sweating and excessive water intake creates imbalances)

Sodium pill (low sodium causes seizes and is one of your highest risks. ESPECIALLY in women)

B-Complex with Niacin (Neuro Protective/Energy)

A multivitamin is never a bad idea. Next day I take turmeric and 5HTP for antioxidants and to replenish serotonin.
