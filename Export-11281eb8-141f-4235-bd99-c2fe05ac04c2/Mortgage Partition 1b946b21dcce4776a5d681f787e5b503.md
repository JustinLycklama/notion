# David’s Advice

Regarding separating out your home ownership, here are the steps to consider.

1. Everything is done as of now. What you paid for the home is irrelevant – all would be done at today’s market values.
2. You would need an up to date appraisal of your home. A real estate agent that you both agree on could do this appraisal, or you can get a professional appraiser to provide market value.
3. Once you determine a price and you both agree on it, then you can move ahead to buy her out.
4. Depending on where your mortgage is, you will have many options.
    1. You can buy the home and assume the mortgage on your own. This may take one of your parents to cosign, but it will not be an issue.
    2. You can keep the ownership jointly, and wait until the mortgage comes due to finalize a buyout, or to maintain joint ownership.

What are the issues here?

If she is an owner, and you both pay the mortgage together, then she still lives in the home, there is no rental income to you, and she is paying down the mortgage amount with every payment.

If she wants to sell the property to you, and you rent to her, you should declare the rental income.  Half of your expenses can be deducted from this income.  Note this can also affect your zero tax gains or losses when you sell, as it was used as a “business” for a period of time to make income.  It is

definitely more complicated.

Returning to #3 above.

If you decide to buy her out now, it would mean a sale to you of her half.

1. This affect the overall price you paid for the home (half is at current market values and half is at your original price). This will be important for capital gains declarations in the future.
2. Technically, a sale usually has a real estate commission of around 2-5%. Given your relationship, you could waive this.
3. You will incur legal fees to buy her out and to put the mortgage in your own name. These legal fees would likely be between $1,000 and $2,000. (This would remove her from ownership and the mortgage obligation.
4. I don’t know if you would be required to pay land transfer fees, given you are already an owner. I suspect they would be waived, but they generally cost around 1.5%. You already paid these when you bought the property.
