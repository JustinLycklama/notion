# Baked Buffalo Chicken Taquitos

Status: New
Type: Food

- 3 cups shredded cooked chicken (rotisserie)
- 4 ounces cream cheese (plain, softened out of fridge 30 mins)
- 1/3 cup buffalo wing sauce (Buffalo wing sauce: Franks, …)
- 1 1/2 cups grated cheddar cheese
- Smaller corn tortillas
- Dipping sauces:
    - Ranch,
    - Garlic Aioli
    - Sour Cream + Cilantro / Chives
    - Chipotle mayo
    - Avocado Crema

## Steps

- **Preheat the oven**: Set your oven to 425°F (220°C) to ensure it’s hot and ready.
- **Prepare the filling**:
    - In a bowl, mix the shredded chicken, softened cream cheese, buffalo sauce, and shredded cheese until well combined. This is your flavorful buffalo chicken filling.
- **Assemble the taquitos**:
    - Place about 2 tablespoons of the buffalo chicken mixture onto one side of each tortilla.
    - Roll the tortilla tightly around the filling, starting from the side where you placed the mixture, making a taquito (like a small burrito).
- **Place on the baking sheet**:
    - Lay each rolled taquito seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or lightly greased.
- **Lightly oil the taquitos**:
    - Lightly spray the taquitos with cooking spray or brush with a little olive oil to help them crisp up in the oven.
- **Bake**:
    - Place the taquitos in the preheated oven and bake for 15–20 minutes or until they’re golden brown and crispy.

## Reheat

**Oven Method (Best for Crispiness)**:

- Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
- Place the taquitos on a baking sheet and bake for 10–15 minutes, or until they’re heated through and crispy again. You can broil them for the last minute to get extra crunch.
