The Devils of Loudon - Aldous Huxley. Horny witches, nuns getting corrupt, opening the doors of perception, etc.

The Corner that Held Them - Sylvia Townsend Warner. Intergenerational medieval lesbian nuns.

The Name of The Rose - Umberto Eco. All time goat of monastic weird literature. There's a murder at the abbey! And a secret lost book! Mysteries and lots of reformation politics! Jorge Luis Borges shows up in medieval Italy! It's awesome
