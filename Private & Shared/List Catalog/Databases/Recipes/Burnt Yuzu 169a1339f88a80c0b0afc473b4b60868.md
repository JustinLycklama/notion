# Burnt Yuzu

Status: New
Type: Drink

### Ingredients:

- **1.5 oz Bourbon Whisky** (base spirit with a smoky, caramel flavor)
- **0.75 oz Yuzu Juice** (adds bright, citrusy tartness)
- **0.5 oz Amontillado Sherry** (brings nutty, oxidative depth)
- **1 oz Whey** (adds a creamy, smooth texture and light tanginess)
- **0.5 oz 12-Year Rum Caramel** (for sweetness and complexity, with molasses and aged rum notes)

### Method:

1. **Prepare the Rum Caramel**:
    - In advance, make a caramel sauce using sugar, a splash of water, and finish it with a small amount of aged 12-year rum for added depth.
    - Let it cool to room temperature.
2. **Combine Ingredients**:
    - Add bourbon, yuzu juice, Amontillado sherry, whey, and the rum caramel to a cocktail shaker.
3. **Add Ice and Shake**:
    - Shake vigorously with ice to chill and combine all the ingredients thoroughly. The whey will give the drink a frothy texture.
4. **Double Strain**:
    - Fine strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass, depending on your presentation preference.
5. **Garnish**:
    - Garnish with a burnt yuzu wheel (lightly torch a slice of yuzu for aroma and dramatic effect) or a twist of yuzu peel.

### Notes:

- **Whey**: Whey is often used in clarified cocktails to add body and reduce sharpness. If the whey is from milk, it may have been created during a milk clarification process.
- **Rum Caramel**: The caramel provides a balance to the tartness of the yuzu and enhances the richness of the bourbon and sherry.
- **Amontillado Sherry**: This adds a layer of nuttiness and dryness, balancing the sweetness and acidity.

This is a refined cocktail with a balanced interplay of smoky, nutty, creamy, and citrusy flavors. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!

In this cocktail context, **whey** refers to the liquid byproduct that remains after milk has been curdled and strained, often during cheese-making or yogurt production. It's used in mixology for its **silky texture, slight tanginess, and ability to mellow out sharp or acidic flavors**.

### Why use whey in cocktails?

1. **Texture**: Whey adds a creamy, smooth mouthfeel without the heaviness of cream or milk.
2. **Flavor**: It has a subtle tangy flavor that pairs well with citrus and other acidic ingredients like yuzu, balancing the drink.
3. **Clarification**: In some cases, bartenders use whey as part of a milk-washing process, where milk or cream is curdled with an acid (like citrus juice), and the curds are strained out, leaving behind a clarified liquid that carries both the rich texture and the nuanced flavors.

### How to make whey for cocktails:

If you're not using pre-made whey, you can make it at home:

1. Heat milk (whole milk works best) gently in a saucepan.
2. Add an acid like lemon juice, lime juice, or vinegar to curdle the milk.
3. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to separate the curds (solids) from the whey (liquid).
4. Collect the liquid whey and store it in the fridge until you're ready to use it

### How to Use Jarred Yuzu for Cocktails:

1. **Dilute it**:
    - Since the jarred yuzu is concentrated and sweetened, mix about **1 part yuzu paste** with **1 part water** to mimic the consistency and tartness of fresh yuzu juice.
    - Taste as you go—you want it to be tangy and citrusy, not overly sweet.
2. **Measure It**:
    - After dilution, measure **0.75 oz** of the liquid as your yuzu "juice" for the cocktail. If it’s still too thick to measure with a jigger, you can eyeball or add a splash more water.
3. **Adjust Sweetness**:
    - The jarred yuzu is already sweetened, so you might not need to use as much of the **rum caramel** in the cocktail. Start with **0.25 oz** rum caramel instead of **0.5 oz**, then adjust to taste.

### Pro Tip:

If you're short on time, you can just spoon **0.5 oz** of the jarred yuzu directly into the shaker and shake it well with the other ingredients. The shaking will help break it down and incorporate it into the drink. Strain the cocktail well to avoid pulp or peel bits.
