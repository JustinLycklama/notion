# Northern Spy (Mordecai)

Status: New
Type: Drink

### Ingredients:

- **2 oz Woodford Reserve Rye** (provides a bold, spicy whiskey base)
- **1 oz Calvados** (adds a crisp, apple-forward depth)
- **0.5 oz Dillon's Vermouth** (a sweet or dry vermouth to enhance complexity—likely sweet here)
- **0.25 oz Cynar** (an artichoke-based bitter liqueur, adds herbal bitterness)
- **2 dashes Peychaud's Bitters** (for a touch of anise and spice)

### Method:

1. **Combine ingredients**: In a mixing glass, add the rye, Calvados, vermouth, Cynar, and bitters.
2. **Add ice**: Fill the mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled (about 20–30 seconds).
3. **Strain**: Strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass (depending on your preference—likely coupe for this style).
4. **Garnish**: Optionally garnish with a twist of orange peel or an apple slice for aroma and presentation.

This cocktail leans into the rye’s spice, the apple-forward nuance of Calvados, the herbal depth from Cynar, and a touch of sweetness and spice from the vermouth and bitters. The proportions balance the bold whiskey with complementary flavors, keeping the drink robust yet nuanced.
