# Burgers

Status: New
Type: Food

Ingredients:

- 1 pound (450g) ground beef (80/20 or 85/15 fat ratio is recommended for juicy burgers)
- 2 slices of bread (white, wheat, or your preferred type)
- 2 large eggs
- 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (optional, but adds extra flavor)
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (optional, but enhances the meaty taste)

For serving:

- Burger buns
- Lettuce leaves
- Sliced tomatoes
- Sliced onions
- Cheese slices (optional)
- Ketchup, mustard, or your favorite burger sauce

Instructions:

1. Prepare the bread: Tear the slices of bread into small pieces or use a food processor to turn them into breadcrumbs.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, minced garlic, breadcrumbs, salt, black pepper, and onion powder. If you're using Worcestershire sauce, add it now as well.
3. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and then add them to the meat mixture. Mix everything together thoroughly, but avoid overmixing as it can make the burgers tough.
4. Shape the mixture into burger patties of your desired size and thickness. Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.
5. Heat a grill, stovetop skillet, or griddle over medium-high heat. Add a little oil to prevent sticking.
6. Cook the burger patties for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your preferred level of doneness (medium-rare, medium, or well-done).
7. In the last minute of cooking, you can optionally add cheese slices on top of the patties to melt.
8. While the patties cook, you can lightly toast the burger buns.
9. Assemble the burgers: Place the cooked patties on the bottom half of each bun. Add lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and onions on top. Add your favorite sauce (ketchup, mustard, etc.) and cover with the top half of the bun.
10. Serve the burgers hot and enjoy!
