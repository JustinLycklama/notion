- Get better at being a friend (not descriptive)

An idea for habit motivation:

- Begin with 2 minute habit, the simplest version of something.
- Repeat that habit every day, and ONLY do 2 minutes of it.
- By doing this you are getting in the mental reps, while reducing the resistance to almost zero
