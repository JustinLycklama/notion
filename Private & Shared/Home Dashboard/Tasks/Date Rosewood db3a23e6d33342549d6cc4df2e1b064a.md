## Relationship Status Check

- [x]  Had weekly relationship touch point

**How is Erin feeling about my attention towards her**

<aside>
💡 Eris is looking for more attention, but that does not mean that I have not been giving her enough. Her needs change day to day and she feels like she needs extra attention today.

</aside>

**What have been any pain points this week**

<aside>
💡 When Erin asks for more attention than normal, I take it as a form of guilt and tell her “I’m sorry” because I assume I have not been giving her enough attention.

Especially because we have been doing these weekly checkins, I should be more secure that she generally is getting the attention she needs, and her calling out for it is because she knows I cannot read minds. She just wants to let me know she is feeling needy, and when I feel guilt at that it creates a negative cycle, where she also feels guilt for brining it up.

**Do I need to come up with new ways to show affection?**

<aside>
💡 Nothing new *needed,* but small random acts always appreciated

</aside>

**What could we use more of in our lives?**

<aside>
💡 Exercise! Sleep. Sleeping together at the same time.

**What could we use less of in our lives?**

<aside>
💡 Memes!
