- Very nice garden to walk around. It would be really nice during cherry blossom season.
- You have to pay 500 yen to get in, so there are fewer people compared to other parks in Tokyo.
- [Suga Shrine](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://g.co/kgs/wfRQqe4%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1743137660233084%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0RoKHrEmswmAuwNeYV8Poi&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743137660244479&usg=AOvVaw2Q2l8nMy9AqeUnDuNuMbU_)
- Famous for the "Your Name" staircase.
- [Gyukatsu Motomura](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://g.co/kgs/54dGxif%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1743137660233265%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3HccMfxeuqjQB6C-ZGo37J&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743137660244607&usg=AOvVaw2wFHHsfYzZUjI4iDPKo81Z)

- Kind of like poke, but a million times better! One of my favorite meals.

## Kyoto

**Fushimi Inari Taisha -** Work you way around to the back of the mountain. Try to find the side trails where nobody is walking, towards [**Ōiwa Ōkami Shrine](https://g.co/kgs/vfqjpze). Alternatively, try going at night!**

**Enryakuji Temple** - Absolutely worth doing the tram up the mountain and the hike down through the village. The Temple is fine to see while you are there, but not the point of the journey.

**Bamboo Forest -** [Arashiyama](https://g.co/kgs/7BhYdmY) worth visiting but can be very touristy, try to hit it early enough in the day so you can explore the gardens nearby. [Sushi Iso](https://g.co/kgs/GpppLmw) is a great dinner spot nearby

**Nishiki Market -** Worth a visit during the day, go for a late breakfast / early lunch and pick up a bunch of random fishy snacks!

## Onomichi

**Bike Route -** The reason to visit! [Shimanami Kaido](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3478.html) is a beautiful route, look up a bike rental place a week ahead and **book an e-bike.** You can probably show up somewhere and find a same day rental, there are lots of shops, but why not be certain.

**アルペジオ ( Arepegio ) Smokehouse bar -** Super cozy bar with a great owner! [http://arpeggio-onomichi.com/](http://arpeggio-onomichi.com/)

**Cat Alley -**  Never made it, heard its great!
