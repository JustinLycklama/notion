These are NOT projects.

Guitar is not a project

3d modeling is not a project.

Shambhala IS a project, and it is complete. I planned for the trip and then went on it.

Blueprince cross stitch is specific.. but is not a project I want to track digitally. It has no milestones and no trackable progression or due date.
