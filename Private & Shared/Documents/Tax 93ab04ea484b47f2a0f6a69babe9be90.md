# How To

1. Go to CRA Account → Tax Documents → Select the previous year and view as PDF. You can see all documents in one PFD this way
2. Iterate through your “Statement of Securities Transactions” and fine matching values in the PDF, to make sure you have everything / there are no duplicates.
3. For each line, check the type of slip it is coming from and compare to below for categorization

## T5008

Any T5008 With a 20 ‘Cost or Book Value’ and a 21 ‘Proceeds of Disposition” will be a capital gains type tax

This applies to virtually all securities transactions on T5008 slips.

<aside>
💡

A T5008 slip would not represent capital gains in a few specific situations:

1. **Return of capital**: When a distribution represents a return of your original investment rather than a profit. This reduces your adjusted cost base but isn't immediately taxable.
2. **Security transfers**: If you're simply moving securities between accounts you own (like from one brokerage to another) without actually selling them.
3. **Errors or corrections**: Sometimes T5008s are issued to correct previous information, and might not represent an actual transaction.
4. **Certain derivatives or futures contracts**: Some specialized financial instruments might generate income that's treated differently than capital gains.
5. **Foreign exchange transactions**: Currency exchange transactions might appear on a T5008 but could be treated differently depending on their purpose.
6. **Bond transactions where interest is reported separately**: The interest component would be interest income, not capital gains.

However, the vast majority of T5008 slips with both "Cost or Book value" and "Proceeds of disposition" do represent potential capital gains or losses transactions. If you're seeing numerous T5008 entries for normal stock or ETF transactions, they are almost certainly capital gains/losses.

</aside>

## T3

These appear in a different section “Trust Allocations” , You can search for T3 to find it.

These are interest income, but are not listed under “Statement of Securities Transactions” and does not give you the option to pick a type.

For a T3 you may have to fill Source Country of Foreign Income

1. head to BMO and get documents, the country is not listed in the bulk PDF from CRA
2. Tax Documents → Consolidated + {Tax Year} → Search for T3
3. 

## Calculation of Cumulative Net Investment Loss T936

Two fields have been auto filled due to investment loss. This may be enough.

<aside>
💡

For the CNIL calculation, if you don't have:

- Rental properties
- Limited partnerships
- Exploration and development expenses
- Investment loans where you're claiming interest expenses

Then you likely only need the investment income fields that have already been filled. The other sections would remain at zero.
