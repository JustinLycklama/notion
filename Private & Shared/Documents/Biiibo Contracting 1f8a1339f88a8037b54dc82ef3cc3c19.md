## Tax

- Do I need to include tax in my invoice? No
    
    As a self-employed software freelancer in Canada earning less than $30,000 annually from your freelance work, you are considered a "small supplier" under the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) regulations. This means you are not required to register for a GST/HST account or charge these taxes to your clients.

    ### Charging GST/HST to Clients
    
    Since you are not registered for GST/HST, you should not add GST/HST to your invoices. Your clients are not responsible for paying this tax unless you are registered and required to collect it.
    
    ### Income Tax Obligations
    
    Regardless of your GST/HST registration status, you are still obligated to report your freelance income on your personal income tax return. This income will be subject to federal and provincial income taxes. You can deduct eligible business expenses to reduce your taxable income.
    
    ### Voluntary GST/HST Registration
    
    While not mandatory, you may choose to register for GST/HST voluntarily. Benefits of voluntary registration include the ability to claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) for GST/HST paid on business-related expenses, such as software subscriptions or equipment purchases. However, once registered, you are required to charge GST/HST on all taxable supplies and file regular GST/HST returns, regardless of your income level.
