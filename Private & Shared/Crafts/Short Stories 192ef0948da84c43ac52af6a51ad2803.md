# Short Stories

The goal here is to have short ‘completable’ tasks I can do to build my sense of being a writer. 

between 1,500 words and 7,500 words

Most short stories seem to be **between 1,500 words and 7,500 words** long so about 3- 30 pages long (a typical printed page is somewhere between 250 and 450 words) depending on font and print formatting. Also, pages of dialogue may have fewer words, which affects length too.
