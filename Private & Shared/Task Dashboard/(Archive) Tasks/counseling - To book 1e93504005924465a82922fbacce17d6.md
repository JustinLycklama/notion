**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**

- identify reactions that contribute to conflict and disconnection
- understand underlying emotions that drive each other’s responses
- learn to be attuned and responsive to each other
- ask in a vulnerable, non-blaming way for your needs to be met
- experience each other as a source of safety and security
- deepen your emotional connection and intimacy
