# 50% Rule

### Study

• At *most*, half of your time spent drawing can be used for studying. This includes your Drawabox homework assignments, work from other courses, as well as self-driven studies or exercises. Basically this half will include anything you draw **with the intent of improving or learning**.

### Play

• At *least* half of your time drawing must be spent on doing it for its own sake. Play. Exploration. Pushing boundaries. **As explained above, many of you will not find this enjoyable**. The intent is not to have fun — the intent is to develop your capacity to enjoy things that don't result in something that looks nice, or that otherwise helps develop your technical skills.

**Can I use reference during the 50% rule time?**

- **If the motivation behind it is *fear*, then no. Face your fear, draw it without reference**.
- Just make sure that what you're drawing is not in its entirety, just a copy of a reference image. That would be a *study*, and would fall into the study portion of the 50% rule.
