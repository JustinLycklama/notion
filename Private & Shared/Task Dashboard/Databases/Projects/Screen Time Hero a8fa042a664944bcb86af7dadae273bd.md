_ Is Active: No

# Mission Statement

We are often fueled by bursts of motivation followed by stretches of ‘discipline’. During the discipline periods you feel like you need to buckle down and stay focused, but the reality is you will not have the energy to decide on your path during these moments. 

We need to use the periods of motivation to angle ourselves in the right direction, so our autopilot can take us in our desired direction with minimal effort

This game is designed with the mindset that we should set ourselves goals while the motivation strikes, and make those goals easy and fun to attain during periods of autopilot
